1. Overview/Introduction
  - explore the factors that influence the number of users of a bike share system
  - time of use patterns
  - relationships between users and quantitate attributes
  - influence of categorical attributes

2. The Data
  - Source - DC Bike Sharing system
  - Obtained from University of California Irvine
  - Parameters in data set
    - Date and Time:
      - year, month, day, hour,
      - derived: season, working day, holiday, day of week
    - Weather:
      - temperature, humidity, weathersit
      -derived:  apparent temperature
    - Users: casual, registered, total user count
  - Processing
    - Aggregate into daily intervals

2. The questions
  - What factors influence the number of casual and registered
 users of the bike share system?
  - How are these factors similar and different between the two types of users
  - How much did ridership increase from 2011 to 2012, accounting for seasonality and weather?
  - Where is growth in ridership coming - casual or registered users?3. The Design Intent

3. Design Intent
  - Show time based patterns using radial and rectilinear line charts
  - Show relationships between continuous variables and the number of users using scatter plots
  - Examine influences of categorical variables (weathersit, workingday, holiday) by filter the radial line plot and scatter plots (using working memory to spot changes in patterns)
  - Look at differences in factors influencing casual and registered users using multiple views grouped type of user
  - Use a one dimensional brush on the overview line chart to select specific time ranges shown in the radial and scatter plots

4. The Visualizations
  - Radial Time Series
    - Data - Users vs Time of day
    - Encoding
      - User as line with time as angular position
      - Color
    - Interpretation -
  - Scatter Plot
    - Data - users (y-axis) vs temp, humidity and windspeed (x-axis)
    - Encoding
        - points shown as circles
        - colors
    - Interpretation
  - Line chart overview
    - Data - total number of daily users (y-axis) vs date
    - Encoding
      - users as line
      - color
    - Interpretation

3. Interactions
  - Panning & zooming from line chart overview
  - Filtering by categorical variables
